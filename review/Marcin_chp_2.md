1.4 say few words what happens with other parts of the Tylor series. 
 From the rest of this section it means that the second order is where 
all ends and it would be nice to say that we can go beyond harmonic 
approximation.

at end of the phonons section it would be nice to wrap it up with 
returning to the 1.3 or 1.4. You spend lots of time to solve the problem 
but you kind of don't say that this is the solution to the harmonic 
approximation of 1.4. It would be also nice to say few words about 
eigenvectors and eigenvalues. What meaning do they have? You could even 
show an example of eigenvectors for a given mode plotted in some 
structure. That math is spot on, all is very clear but after all that 
shebang it would be nice to wrap it up. It is nice in such a 
mathematical texts to show more of application side or real-life meaning 
of things

I think that the equation of motion part should not be part of NVE 
section. It should be a section on its own. I think that if you are 
describing canonical ensemble you should give the same space to 
Nose-Hoover as this one is at least the same popular choice as the 
Langevin. Also, to keep it less dry, it is a nice place to say what are 
strengths and weakness of each thermostat and why/where would you use 
it.

Harmonic mapping is not my cup of tea so It is hard to say anything but 
looks dope.
