\label{chp:results}

After introducing the implementation of the \emph{ab initio} Green Kubo (aiGK) method in the previous chapter, we are now in position to present results for the set of potential thermal insulators identified in chapter~\ref{chp:anharmonicity}.

We first discuss the question of simulation time convergence for an initial set of materials in order to predict systems which can be computed with a simulation time of 30-60\,ps. This time was chosen as a compromise between the finite amount of available computational ressources and the desire to compute as many materials from the list of candidates as possible.

In a second step, we compare the computed thermal conductivities at room temperature to experimental references for the subset of materials for which experiments are available to further verify the aiGK method beyond the two materials presented in the previous chapter.

In the last step, we present the computed thermal conductivities for the remaining materials,~i.\,e.,~those for which no experimental thermal conductivity was reported before, and discuss how they fit into the schema of predicting thermal insulators from anharmonicity estimates as discussed in Sec.\,\ref{sec:kappa_vs_sigmaA}. We eventually highlight the particularly interesting class of chalcopyrite compounds and try to answer some open questions from experimental and semi-empirical theoretical literature.

\section{Convergence estimation}
We discuss simulation time convergence in the light of the \emph{effective simulation time} introduced in Sec.\,\ref{sec:implementation.convergece}. The key idea is to identify lower boundaries for the \emph{necessary} effective simulation time in a material in order to asses whether a time-converged thermal conductivity is possible to obtain within a simulation time of 30-60\,ps. For choosing these boundaries, we leverage the observed convergence behavior of seven materials,~i.\,e.,~MgO, NaF, KMgF$_3$, NaCl, NaBr, CuI, and NaI, each of them computed with 60\,ps simulation time. We thereby define four thresholds of minimal effective simulation time based on a material's anharmonicity $\sigmaA$, reflecting that phonons in harmonic materials like MgO have longer lifetimes than those in anharmonic materials. The criteria are displayed in Fig.\,\ref{fig:results.convergence}. In particular, we define the thresholds $\teff > 240$ for harmonic materials with $\sigmaA \leq 0.2$, $\teff > 120$ for materials with $0.2 < \sigmaA \leq 0.3$, $\teff > 60$ for materials with $0.3 < \sigmaA \leq 0.4$, and $\teff > 45$ for materials with $\sigmaA > 0.4$.

%The rational for this approach is that for individual materials, one would always compute several times longer trajectories to ensure that all relevant contributions are captured. In turn, several times less materials could be computed with a given amount of computational resources. Here, we leverage observations across different materials to circumvent this necessity for individual materials, thereby allowing to compute good estimates for thermal conductivity for dozens of them.

Lower right: $\teff = 45$ for materials with $\sigmaA > 0.4$.}
	\label{fig:results.convergence}
\end{figure}
%
We point out that at this stage, the given thresholds are meant as a \emph{necessary} condition for convergence, which ensures that a significant contribution to the cumulative thermal conductivity is included in the simulation. A statement about the \emph{sufficient} simulation time, however, can only made on the level of individual trajectories by means of longer simulation times. This verification should therefore be reserved for materials that show interesting properties after the \emph{necessary} simulation time.

Based on this estimation, we identify \todo{check} 57~materials out of the list of \todo{check} 112~candidates to compute thermal conductivity on, and discuss those in the following: First we compare thermal conductivities for \CHECK 21 of these 57 materials to the experimental literature in order to benchmark the aiGK method, afterwards we present and discuss our findings for the remaining \CHECK 36 materials without experimental reference.

\section{Comparison to Experiment}
\label{sec:results.experiments}
In order to asses the validity of the aiGK method for the computation of thermal conductivity in anharmonic compounds, we compare results for 21 materials to the experimental literature. A detailed list including all considered experimental references is given in Tab.\,\ref{tab:kappa.exp} in appendix~\ref{sec:app.experiments}. The difficulties when comparing to experimental references have been discussed in detail for periclase MgO in Sec.\,\ref{sec:mgo.experiments}. In principle, these carry over to all other compounds, however, for most materials, the body of literature is much smaller compared to MgO. The list of experiments also includes measurements on polycrystalline samples. While thermal conductivity should be reduced in polycrystalline samples compared to single crystals because of boundary scattering, experimental studies have shown that the effect is minor in sufficiently dense polycrystalline samples, especially in low thermal conductivity materials which are less sensitive to boundary scattering due to their intrinsically low phonon mean free paths~\cite{charvat1957}. In the course of our literature review we have generally found differences of 0-20\,\% between measurements on single- and polycrystalline samples, which supports this finding. Nevertheless, additional care must be taken when evaluating literature on polycrystalline samples: Experiments aiming at measuring other properties besides thermal conductivity, in particular the thermoelectric figure of merit $zT$, typically do not attempt to reproduce the bulk thermal conductivity, and use less dense samples, which is beneficial for reducing thermal conductivity and thereby increasing the figure of merit. The resulting thermal conductivity will then be influenced severely by the details of the sample processing, and a comparison to bulk thermal conductivity is not meaningful. However, some experiments specifically aim at reproducing polycrystalline samples of near-bulk density in order to assess the bulk thermal conductivity of a material. Only experiments on polycrystalline samples of this type are considered in this work.

A comparison of thermal conductivities computed via the aiGK method as introduced in the previous chapter and the experimental literature is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:kappa_exp}.
%
\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./data/plots/kappa_vs_exp_trusted/kappa_vs_exp_corrected_annotated.pdf}

	\label{fig:kappa_exp}
\end{figure}
%
Overall, we find very good agreement in the 21 considered materials, with 10 out of 21 being within experimental accuracy of $\pm 15\,\%$, and all other within an extended %experimental 
accuracy which we choose as $\pm 50\,\%$ within the average experimental reference, reflecting the high degree of variation in experimental values for materials where a significant amount of references is available, see especially the discussion in Ref.\,\cite{wei2016}. 

\begin{marginfigure}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./data/plots/heat_capacity/225.LiH/thermal_properties.pdf}
	\caption{Harmonic heat capacity per formula unit $c_V^{\rm ha}$ for LiH compared to the classical Dulong-Petit value.}
	\label{fig:LiH.cv}
\end{marginfigure}
%
The strongest deviation from experiment is seen for LiH, which is computed as $\kappa^{\rm aiGK} = 23.6 \pm 4.0$\,W/mK, where the available experimental value is $\kappa^{\rm exp} = 14.7$\,W/mK~\cite{slack1973}. However, both lithium and especially hydrogen are light elements, so that LiH is not fully classical at room temperature, as can be estimated by comparing the harmonic heat capacity of LiH at 300\,K to the classical Dulong-Petit value in Fig.\,\ref{fig:LiH.cv}~\cite{Dove}. The harmonic heat capacity for LiH is only at about 50\,\% of the classically expected value of $6 R = 49.9$\,J/mol/K for solids with two atoms in the unitcell. This value can only be taken as an upper boundary to the deviation in thermal tranpsort properties expected from the lack of nuclear quantum effects, since low-frequency phonon modes already behave more classical at the given temperature~\cite{Volz2020,Volz2020b}.  A significant overestimation by the classical Green Kubo method can nevertheless be expected in this material. Interestingly, the aiGK value agrees very well with another computational study by Lindsay, who found a value of $\kappa = 23.00$\,W/mK using third-order Boltzmann transport~\cite{lindsay2016}.\footnote{Lindsay used an LDA exchange-correlation functional, which can deviate $\pm 20\,\%$ from the PBEsol functional used in this work~\cite{Carbogno2016}. However, the disagreement with experiment is still significantly larger then the potential inaccuracy stemming from the xc functional.} In that approach, the quantum nature of nuclei should be better captured than in the aiGK method, and Lindsay ascribes the deviation from experiment to higher-order phonon-phonon interactions neglected in their approach. This discussion is in line with the more phenomenological discussion proposed by Slack in Ref.\,\cite{slack1973}, where he points out the strong anharmonicity in LiH that manifests in the change of phonon frequencies as measured by the Gr\"uneisen parameter. Indeed, in this study we find a value of $\sigmaA = 0.30$ for the strength of anharmonicity in LiH, which can be expected to be even larger when nuclear quantum effects are considered.\footnote{NQE increase the anharmonic strength of LiH at room temperature to about $\sigmaA = 0.36$~\cite{hengst1}.} We therefore suggest LiH as an interesting yet simple candidate for studying the interplay of strong anharmoncity and nuclear quantum effects in bulk solids in future work.


\section{New materials and relation to anharmonicity}
\label{sec:results.new}
After validating the aiGK method against experimental literature, we present results for \todo{check}32~materials \emph{without} experimental reference. We display these values in the context of the $\kappa$ vs. $\sigmaA$ plot introduced in Fig.\,\ref{fig:anh.kappa}, where we identified a power-law relation of experimental thermal conductivities with the anharmonicity measure $\sigmaA$ for simple elementary and binary materials. We show the data again in Fig.\,\ref{fig:kappa_sigma_exp_comp}, but this time including the additional, non-experimentally measured materials computed in this work.
%

	\caption{Summary of the range of thermal conductivities for materials without experimental reference found in this study.}
	\label{fig:kappa_wo_exp_hist}
\end{marginfigure}
%
It is apparent that the correlation between thermal conductivity $\kappa$ and $\sigmaA$ carries over from the simple materials to the more complex binary and ternary compound classes studied in this work, since the power-law fit in Fig.\,\ref{fig:kappa_sigma_exp_comp} is still performed with respect to the experimental values initially presented in Fig.\,\ref{fig:anh.kappa}. While the overall trend of decreasing thermal conductivity with increasing anharmonicity is clearly preserved, the spread of $\kappa$ values for materials with similar $\sigmaA$ or vice versa increases, which is expected due to the increased structural and chemical complexity of the studied materials.

Focusing on the new materials, we show a zoomed-in part of the $\kappa-\sigmaA$ plane in Fig.\,\ref{fig:kappa_sigma}, with only computational data, highlighting the materials where no experimental reference is available.

	\label{fig:kappa_sigma}
\end{figure*}
%
In particular, we find 28 new materials with a computed bulk thermal conductivity of $\kappa^{\rm aiGK} < 10\,{\rm W/mK}$, 24 of which show $\kappa^{\rm aiGK} < 5\,{\rm W/mK}$, and 8 with $\kappa^{\rm aiGK} \leq 2\,{\rm W/mK}$,~i.\,e.,~comparable to the bulk thermal conductivity of existing and candidate thermoelectric materials such as Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (1.3\,W/mK~\cite{Goldsmid1956,Satterthwaite1957}), PbTe (2.0\,W/mK~\cite{ElSharkawy1983}), SnSe (1\,W/mK~\cite{zhao2014,wei2016,sassi2014}), M$_2$Sb$_3$ (2.3\,W/mK~\cite{ahmadpour2007,pan2020}), or GeTe (2.5\,W/mK~\cite{Perumal2015}). A full list of all values is given in Tab.\,\ref{tab:kappa.noexp}, and a histogram of the values is shown in Fig.\,\ref{fig:kappa_wo_exp_hist}. The materials of very low thermal conductivity comprise simple binary, cubic materials such as the rock salt structures CsF ($\kappa^{\rm aiGK} = 0.84$) and LiI ($\kappa^{\rm aiGK} = 1.07$), or the fluorite structure Na$_2$Te ($\kappa^{\rm aiGK} = 1.64$), but also more complex structures such as the strongly anharmonic perovskites KCdF$_3$ ($\kappa^{\rm aiGK} = 1.67$) and KCaF$_3$ ($\kappa^{\rm aiGK} = 2.00$).


\subsection{Chalcopyrite systems}
\label{sec:chalcopyrites}
Particularly noteworthy is a class of ternary materials, so-called \emph{chalcopyrites}, a tetragonal crystal class closely related to the zincblende structure~\cite{wasim1979}. These crystals have been studied in the past primarily because of their non-linear optical properties~\cite{ho2014}, but also thermal transport properties have been studied~\cite{spitzer1970,wasim1979,garbato1979}, mainly because thermal transport can limit the optical efficiency in these devices~\cite{beasley1994}. However, experimental references for this class of materials are scarce, and do not agree well~\cite{beasley1994}.

Picking AgGaSe$_2$ as an example, there are two distinct measurements available as summarized in Tab.\,\ref{tab:exp.aggase2}, ranging from $1.1-2.7$\,W/mK~\cite{beasley1994,berger1969}. These values are complemented by calculated values based on semi-empirical models, ranging from $4.8-9.0$\,W/mK~\cite{wasim1979,rincon1995}. Our computed thermal conductivities are collected in Tab.\,\ref{tab:exp.chalcopyrites}.

Besides AgGaSe$_2$, there is experimental reference for the chemically closely related material, AgGaS$_2$, with a measured thermal conductivity of 1.4\,W/mK~\cite{beasley1994}.\footnote{While we included AgGaS$_2$ in our dataset, we needed to discard the material because of aiMD convergence problems. However, we like to mention this material in the context of this study as potentially interesting material for future investigations.} While our computational data might underestimate the thermal conductivity in these compounds slightly\footnote{Please keep in mind, that the absolute errors are only of the order of 0.5-1\,W/mK.}, we nevertheless see a clear indiciation of very low intrinsic thermal conductivity in AgGaSe$_2$, and the chemically closely related compounds AgAlS$_2$ and AgAlSe$_2$. At least regarding their thermal transport properties, they are therefore comparable or even superior to the existing thermoelectric materials listed in the previous section, while being free of heavy metals such as Pb or Bi.

To qualitatively elucidate the nuclear dynamics of the chalcopyrite systems, we present phonon spectral functions obtained from a temperature dependent model Hamiltonian for the nuclear system up to third-order displacements to estimate phonon-phonon interactions in Fig.\,\ref{fig:sqe_all}~\cite{Hellman2013,Hellman2013b,Squires}.

The common feature of these dispersions are the very flat acoustic branches which vary less than 1\,THz across the entire Brillouin zone, and a multitude of flat, nearly degenerate optical branches showing very litte to no dispersion. From a phonon-theory point of view, non-dispersive branches correspond to localized atomic motion in the system and therefore carry little heat beyond the Einstein-like diffusion of thermal energy from atom to atom, which is the dominant heat transport mechanism in structurally disordered systems like glasses~\cite{Simoncelli2019}. Furthermore, in particular the optical branches are substantially broadened, which corresponds to strong anharmonic coupling in these systems, reducing their thermal conductivity.

\section{Conclusion}
We have estimated the convergence of aiGK simulations in terms of an effective simulation time focusing on the slow degrees of freedom of the system, and validated the approach against experimental values from the literature. In total, we computed thermal conductivities for \todo{check} 57 materials and verified our screening approach in terms of the anharmonicity measure $\sigmaA$. We found that the overall trend of decreasing thermal conductivity when anharmonicity increases initially inferred from the set of simple compounds carried over qualitatively to the more complex bulk materials considered in this work. We presented thermal conductivities for \todo{check} 32 materials where experiemental reference is not yet available, and identified the family of chalcopyrite crystals as a potentially interesting class of low thermal conductivity compounds, with several systems showing very low thermal conductivity of $\kappa \approx 1$\,W/mK at room temperature, which is comparable to or even below currently investigated thermoelectric candidates such as SnSe or Mg$_2$Sb$_3$~\cite{zhao2014,wei2016,sassi2014,pan2020,kajikawa2003,condron2006,zhang2009,zhang2018,ding2021}
