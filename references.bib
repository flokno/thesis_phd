We show that the strong quartic anharmonicity of rattling guest atoms causes the hardening of vibrational frequencies of low-lying optical modes and thereby affects calculated lattice thermal conductivities κL significantly, resulting in an improved agreement with experimental results including the deviation from κL∝T-1 at high temperature. Moreover, our static simulations with various different cell volumes shows a transition from crystal-like to glasslike κL around 20 K. Our analyses suggest that the resonance dip of κL observed in clathrates with large guest free spaces is attributed mainly to the strong three-phonon scattering of acoustic modes along with the presence of higher-frequency dispersive optical modes.}},

  abstract     = {{We show that the commonly used lowest-order theory of phonon-phonon interactions frequently fails to accurately describe the anharmonic phonon decay rates and thermal conductivity (κ), even among strongly bonded crystals. Applying a first-principles theory that includes both the lowest-order three-phonon and the higher-order four-phonon processes to 17 zinc blende semiconductors, we find that the lowest-order theory drastically overestimates the measured κ for many of these materials, while inclusion of four-phonon scattering gives significantly improved agreement with measurements. We identify new selection rules on three-phonon processes that help explain many of these failures in terms of anomalously weak anharmonic phonon decay rates predicted by the lowest-order theory competing with four-phonon processes. We also show that zinc blende compounds containing boron (B), carbon (C), or nitrogen (N) atoms have exceptionally weak four-phonon scattering, much weaker than in compounds that do not contain B, C, or N atoms. This new understanding helps explain the ultrahigh κ in several technologically important materials like cubic boron arsenide, boron phosphide, and silicon carbide. At the same time, it not only makes the possibility of achieving high κ in materials without B, C, or N atoms unlikely, but it also suggests that it may be necessary to include four-phonon processes in many future studies. Our work gives new insights into the nature of anharmonic processes in solids and demonstrates the broad importance of higher-order phonon-phonon interactions in assessing the thermal properties of materials.}},

  abstract     = {{We describe and benchmark the quasi-four-component (Q4C) approach to relativistic density functional simulations of molecules and solids, using precise, numerically tabulated atom-centered orbital (NAO) basis sets to discretize Dirac's equation. The Q4C approach initially projects the atomic solution to (electron-only) positive-energy states and eventually deals with only two components but retains the precision of traditional four-component (4C) relativistic methods. While Q4C inherently reduces the dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix in diagonalization, the adoption of localized NAO basis functions in solids further limits the computational demand in real space operations, promising a pathway to investigate large and complex systems containing heavy elements with the precision of a 4C method. Here, we first perform validation and benchmark calculations for cohesive properties of a set of diatomic molecules and of previously established periodic model systems (i.e., silver halides). Then we report Q4C relativistic energy band structure benchmarks for a series of 103 periodic materials, including chemical elements up to Bi, and providing quantitative comparisons with more approximate scalar-relativistic and spin-orbit coupled treatments. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the method to band structure calculations of simple and complex hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites containing Pb and Bi, i.e., Cs2AgBiCl6 and a larger system (containing 94 atoms per unit cell), (4-FPEA)2PbI4. The effect of full Q4C, compared with scalar relativity, on binding energies can be significant even for relatively light p-orbital bonded main group elements such as Br and I—i.e., 0.3 and 0.6 eV for Br2 and I2 binding energies, respectively.}},

Reference energy band structures for the PBE density functional are obtained using the full-potential (linearized) augmented plane wave code wien2k, employing its self-consistent treatment of SOC including Dirac-type p1/2 orbitals in the basis set. We use this benchmark set to benchmark a computationally simpler, non-self-consistent all-electron treatment of SOC based on scalar-relativistic orbitals and numeric atom-centered orbital basis functions. For elements up to Z≈50, both treatments agree virtually exactly. For the heaviest elements considered (Tl, Pb, Bi, Po), the band-structure changes due to SOC are captured with a relative deviation of 11\% or less. For different density functionals (PBE versus the hybrid HSE06), we show that the effect of spin-orbit coupling is usually similar but can be dissimilar if the qualitative features of the predicted underlying scalar-relativistic band structures do not agree. All band structures considered in this work are available online via the NOMAD repository to aid in future benchmark studies and methods development.}},

With this understanding, strategies for combining these mechanisms can be formulated for designing new materials with exceptionally low thermal conductivity.}},

He did this by scaling time (with s) and distance (with V1/D in D dimensions) through Lagrangian equations of motion. The dynamical equations describe the evolution of these two scaling variables and their two conjugate momenta ps and pv. Here we develop a slightly different set of equations, free of time scaling. We find the dynamical steady-state probability density in an extended phase space with variables x, px, V, ε̇, and ζ, where the x are reduced distances and the two variables ε̇ and ζ act as thermodynamic friction coefficients. We find that these friction coefficients have Gaussian distributions. From the distributions the extent of small-system non-Newtonian behavior can be estimated. We illustrate the dynamical equations by considering their application to the simplest possible case, a one-dimensional classical harmonic oscillator.}},

In numerical applications this quantity can be used to measure the accuracy of the sampling. The authors illustrate the properties of this new method on Lennard-Jones and TIP4P water models in the solid and liquid phases. Its performance is excellent and largely independent of the thermostat parameter also with regard to the dynamic properties.}},

  abstract     = {{Atomistic simulations of chemical, biological and materials systems have become increasingly precise and predictive owing to the development of accurate and efficient techniques that describe the quantum mechanical behaviour of electrons. Nevertheless, the overwhelming majority of such simulations still assumes that the nuclei behave as classical particles. Historically, this approximation could sometimes be justified owing to the complexity and computational overhead. However, neglecting nuclear quantum effects has become one of the largest sources of error, especially when systems containing light atoms are treated using current state-of-the-art descriptions of chemical interactions. Over the past decade, this realization has spurred a series of methodological advances that have dramatically reduced the cost of including these important physical effects in the structure and dynamics of chemical systems. Here, we discuss how these developments are now allowing nuclear quantum effects to become a mainstream feature of molecular simulations. These advances have led to new insights into phenomena that are relevant to different areas of science — from biochemistry to condensed matter — and open the door to many exciting future opportunities. The approximation underlying most atomistic simulations to treat nuclei classically can lead to large errors and the failure to capture important physical effects. This Review reports on recent developments that enable modelling of quantum nuclei at a computational cost comparable with that of a classical simulation.}},

Fully anharmonic temperature-dependent calculations of these quantities are challenging due to the cost associated with statistically converging trajectory-based methods, especially when accounting for nuclear quantum effects. Here, we train a high-dimensional neural network potential energy surface for the porphycene molecule based on data generated with DFT-B3LYP, including pairwise van der Waals interactions. In addition, we fit a kernel ridge regression model for the molecular dipole moment surface. The combination of this machinery with thermostatted path integral molecular dynamics (TRPMD) allows us to obtain well-converged, full-dimensional, fully-anharmonic vibrational spectra including nuclear quantum effects, without sacrificing the first-principles quality of the potential-energy surface or the dipole surface. Within this framework, we investigate the temperature and isotopologue dependence of the high-frequency vibrational fingerprints of porphycene. While classical-nuclei dynamics predicts a red shift of the vibrations encompassing the NH and CH stretches, TRPMD predicts a strong blue shift in the NH-stretch region and a smaller one in the CH-stretch region. We explain this behavior by analyzing the modulation of the effective potential with temperature, which arises from vibrational coupling between quasi-classical thermally activated modes and high-frequency quantized modes.}},

We illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of our method for H2 interacting with the (2×2) potassium covered Pd(100) surface. The sticking probability of H2/K(2×2)/Pd(100) is determined by molecular dynamics simulations on the neural network PES and compared to results using an independent analytical interpolation.}},

If it is taken that the system size must be larger than the phonon mean free path, several hundreds of millions of atoms must be computed for crystals with large thermal conductivity values such as Si. We demonstrate in this work that the thermal conductivity of Si crystals can be simulated by MD techniques using several thousands of atoms with periodic boundary conditions. We identify that the key issues generating size artifacts in small molecular-dynamics systems are the frequency cutoff imposed by the simulation domain length and the correlation artifacts caused by the periodic boundary conditions. Our method relies on the spectral Green-Kubo formulation combined with a model-based extrapolation. The obtained thermal conductivity results are in good agreement with the reference data. Both the Green-Kubo formulation and the Boltzmann transport equation lead to the prediction that the thermal conductivities of bulk crystals depend on the frequency of the thermal disturbance. This result has important implications for high-frequency electronic devices.}},

The method mimics the so-called “laser-flash” technique to measure thermal conductivities. It starts with first-principles density-functional theory and involves the preparation of various regions of a supercell at slightly different temperatures. The temperature fluctuations are minimized without using a thermostat and, after averaging over random initial conditions, temperature changes as small as 5 K can be monitored (from 120 to 125 K). The changes to the phonon density of states and the specific heat induced by several atomic percent of impurities are discussed. The thermal conductivity of Si supercells is calculated as a function of the temperature and of the impurity content. For most impurities, the drop in thermal conductivity is unremarkable. However, there exist narrow ranges of impurity parameters (mass, bond strength, etc.) for which substantial drops in the thermal conductivity are predicted. These drops are isotope dependent and appear to be related to the vibrational lifetime of specific impurity-related modes.}},

Nonintuitively, high accuracy is achieved when the model is trained on first-principles forces in quasirandom atomic configurations.

@article{Fransson2020,
  abstract     = {{Linear models, such as force constant (FC) and cluster expansions, play a key role in physics and materials science. While they can in principle be parametrized using regression and feature selection approaches, the convergence behavior of these techniques, in particular with respect to thermodynamic properties is not well understood. Here, we therefore analyze the efficacy and efficiency of several state-of-the-art regression and feature selection methods, in particular in the context of FC extraction and the prediction of different thermodynamic properties. Generic feature selection algorithms such as recursive feature elimination with ordinary least-squares (OLS), automatic relevance determination regression, and the adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator can yield physically sound models for systems with a modest number of degrees of freedom. For large unit cells with low symmetry and/or high-order expansions they come, however, with a non-negligible computational cost that can be more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of OLS. In such cases, OLS with cutoff selection provides a viable route as demonstrated here for both second-order FCs in large low-symmetry unit cells and high-order FCs in low-symmetry systems. While regression techniques are thus very powerful, they require well-tuned protocols. Here, the present work establishes guidelines for the design of protocols that are readily usable, e.g., in high-throughput and materials discovery schemes. Since the underlying algorithms are not specific to FC construction, the general conclusions drawn here also have a bearing on the construction of other linear models in physics and materials science.}},

  abstract     = {{Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT) is the basis of modern computational approaches to electronic structures. Their accuracy heavily relies on the exchange-correlation energy functional, which encapsulates electron–electron interaction beyond the classical model. As its universal form remains undiscovered, approximated functionals constructed with heuristic approaches are used for practical studies. However, there are problems in their accuracy and transferability, while any systematic approach to improve them is yet obscure. In this study, we demonstrate that the functional can be systematically constructed using accurate density distributions and energies in reference molecules via machine learning. Surprisingly, a trial functional machine learned from only a few molecules is already applicable to hundreds of molecules comprising various first- and second-row elements with the same accuracy as the standard functionals. This is achieved by relating density and energy using a flexible feed-forward neural network, which allows us to take a functional derivative via the back-propagation algorithm. In addition, simply by introducing a nonlocal density descriptor, the nonlocal effect is included to improve accuracy, which has hitherto been impractical. Our approach thus will help enrich the DFT framework by utilizing the rapidly advancing machine-learning technique.}},
