## Results

### Comparison to literature

- [x] compare to **experiments**
- [ ] how big are the errors we're seeing?
- [ ] compare to BTE results

### Overview results

- [ ] $\kappa$ vs. $\sigma^{\rm A}$ 
    - [ ] by spacegroup?
- [ ] histogram of thermal conductivities
- [ ] overview of non-trivial dynamical effects we see
    - [ ] (onset of) phase transitions
    - [ ] defect formation
    - [ ] dynamical stabilization

## Implementation

### Heat flux

- [ ] Heat flux (total)
- [ ] Heat flux autocorrelation (total)
- [ ] Heat flux (w/o gauge-invariant part)
- [ ] resulting autocorrelation function
- [ ] comparison resulting thermal conductivities

### Noise cancelling

- [ ] filtering strategy



## Problems

- [ ] how to assess supercell size error?
- [ ] how to assess finite-time error?
    - [ ] thermal conductivity as function of simulation time
        - [ ] LJ
        - [ ] materials w/ 60ps simulation time
