# Plan

## KW 15: analyze and plot

### 12.04.

- [x] submit remaining materials to LISE
- [x] integrate interpolation in GK workflow
    - [ ] ~~compute $\kappa^\alpha$ instead of $\kappa^{\alpha \beta}$~~
    - [x] add ha-q data to dataset
- [ ] streamline and run for completed materials
- [ ] extract results and statistics
    - [ ] e.g. lifetimes
- [ ] submit el. DOS for CuI w/ and w/o defects

### 13.04.

- [ ] update plots:
    - [ ] thermal conductivity vs. experiment, w/ and w/o interpolation
    - [ ] thermal conductivity vs. anharmonicity, w/ and w/o interpolation
- [ ] List materials that are far away from exp.
- [ ] List materials for which interpolation goes wrong
- [ ] Choose materials for further analysis
    - [ ] CuI
    - [ ] KCaF3
    - [ ] AgI?
    - [ ] MgSb?
    - [ ] ?
- [ ] impact of simulation time? try to estimate

### 14.04.

- [ ] discuss w/ Chris
    - [ ] paper review

- [ ] benchmark chapter
    - [ ] MgO and CuI (for example)
    - [ ] heat flux
    - [ ] gauge invariant terms
    - [ ] harmonic flux (${\bf J}^{\rm ha-{\bf r}}$ and ${\bf J}^{\rm ha-{\bf q}}$)
    - [ ] with effective phonons?
    - [ ] noise filtering approach
    - [ ] analytic interpolation scheme
    - [ ] discuss convergence w.r.t. simulation time
    - [ ] lattice expansion? Comparison to NPT run?
- [x] schedule meeting w/ Matthias
- [ ] list open questions

### 15.04.
