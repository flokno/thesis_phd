# Initial Plan

## KW 15: analyze and plot

### 12.04.

- [x] submit remaining materials to LISE
- [x] integrate interpolation in GK workflow
    - [ ] ~~compute $\kappa^\alpha$ instead of $\kappa^{\alpha \beta}$~~
    - [x] add ha-q data to dataset
- [x] streamline and run for completed materials
- [ ] extract results and statistics
    - [ ] e.g. lifetimes
- [ ] submit el. DOS for CuI w/ and w/o defects

### 13.04.

- [x] update plots:
    - [x] thermal conductivity vs. experiment, w/ and w/o interpolation
    - [x] thermal conductivity vs. anharmonicity, w/ and w/o interpolation
- [x] List materials that are far away from exp.
- [x] List materials for which interpolation goes wrong
- [x] Choose materials for further analysis
    - [ ] CuI
    - [ ] KCaF3
    - [ ] AgI?
    - [ ] MgSb?
    - [ ] ?
- [ ] impact of simulation time? try to estimate

    - [ ] harmonic flux (${\bf J}^{\rm ha-{\bf r}}$ and ${\bf J}^{\rm ha-{\bf q}}$)
    - [ ] with effective phonons?
    - [ ] noise filtering approach
    - [ ] analytic interpolation scheme
    - [ ] discuss convergence w.r.t. simulation time
