  abstract     = {Scandia (Sc 2 O 3 ) is a ceramic material that shows interesting thermal and optical properties, but is difficult to grow as single crystals. As an alternative, in this work we fabricated polycrystalline Sc 2 O 3 transparent ceramics via vacuum sintering, using powders thermally pyrolyzed at 1200 °C from a scandium sulfate salt, Sc 2 (SO 4 ) 3 {$\cdot$} 7.8H 2 O, that we prepared. Characterization of the powders was achieved by differential thermal analysis/thermogravimetry, x-ray diffractometry, Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis, and field-emission scanning electron microscopy. Sintering behaviors of the Sc 2 O 3 powders were studied in air via dilatometry. The sulfate salt transforms to oxide at temperatures {$\geq$}1000 °C, and the best pyrolysis temperature for transparent ceramics fabrication is 1200 °C, at which the resultant Sc 2 O 3 powder is good in dispersion, ultrafine in particle size ({$\sim$}80 nm), and almost free from residual sulfur. Transparent ceramics were fabricated from this powder via vacuum sintering at 1625 °C or above. The ceramics sintered at 1700 °C for 4 h exhibit an in-line transmittance of approximately 56–58\% in the visible light region at a sample thickness of 1.0 mm.},

Both RbCaF3 and KMnF3 have anomalous thermal conductivities with a strong minimum near their lower-temperature structure change, 45 and 92 K, respectively; and the conductivities of both materials approach a normal lattice conductivity at the high temperatures. The 198- and 187-K cubic-to-tetragonal transitions appear to have only a small effect on the thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of both materials appears to be limited by phonon scattering associated with soft modes at the structural phase transitions.},

This difference can be related to the differences in other parameters of the two compounds. At the lower end of the temperature range, the thermal resistivities, {$\lambda-$}1, of both materials are linear; but large positive deviations occur at the higher end of the range. Calculated values using an equation for acoustic phonon conduction agree with the experimental values to within 30\% over the entire measurement range. The positive deviations from linearity appear to be due to the effect of lattice dilation on the Debye temperatures and Grüneisen constants.},

  abstract     = {Ternary Mg 3 (Bi,Sb) 2 single crystals showing high thermoelectric performance are for the first time grown by the Mg flux method. , The rapid growth of the thermoelectric cooler market makes the development of novel room temperature thermoelectric materials of great importance. Ternary n-type Mg 3 (Bi,Sb) 2 alloys are promising alternatives to the state-of-the-art Bi 2 (Te,Se) 3 alloys but grain boundary resistance is the most important limitation. n-type Mg 3 (Bi,Sb) 2 single crystals with negligible grain boundaries are expected to have particularly high zT but have rarely been realized due to the demanding Mg-rich growth conditions required. Here, we report, for the first time, the thermoelectric properties of n-type Mg 3 (Bi,Sb) 2 alloyed single crystals grown by a one-step Mg-flux method using sealed tantalum tubes. High weighted mobility {$\sim$}140 cm 2 V -1 s -1 and a high zT of 0.82 at 315 K are achieved in Y-doped Mg 3 Bi 1.25 Sb 0.75 single crystals. Through both experimental angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we denote the origin of the high thermoelectric performance from a point of view of band widening effect and electronegativity, as well as the necessity to form high Bi/Sb ratio ternary Mg 3 (Bi,Sb) 2 alloys. The present work paves the way for further development of Mg 3 (Bi,Sb) 2 for near room temperature thermoelectric applications.},

Measurements were made in the temperature range 100 to 400 K, and at pressures up to 2 GPa. cp(P, T) could be adequately described if the acoustic modes were represented by a Debye model and the optic modes by an Einstein model. Analysis of {$\lambda$}(T) showed that only the acoustic modes needed to be taken into account up to 300 K, but that the optic modes were increasingly effective in carrying heat at higher temperatures. {$\lambda$}(P) was adequately described by the Lawson formula, but not by the Leibfried-Schlömann formula, to which it is formally equivalent.

  abstract     = {Using the transient hot-wire method, measurements were made for solid NaBr of both the thermal conductivity and the heat capacity per unit volume. The measurements were performed in the temperature range 100 to 400 K and at pressures up to 2 GPa. An adiabatic compression technique allowed the determination of the thermal expansivity as a function of pressure at room temperature. The heat capacity did not vary with pressure. Analysis of the thermal conductivity data showed that it can be described adequately by the Leibfried-Schlömann formula. For temperatures up to 400 K only acoustic modes needed to be taken into account. A small contribution of optic modes to the heat transport might be apparent at the highest temperatures.},

These compounds have the same crystal structure of the perovskite type and are antiferromagnetic except for diamagnetic KZnF 3 . The anomalous decreases are shown in the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity for the magnetic crystals of KMnF 3 and KCoF 3 at their Néel temperatures of 88°{} and 114°K respectively, but KNiF 3 has no anomaly at its Néel temperature of 275°K. These anomalies are seemed to be due to the phonon-magnon scattering similarily to the cases of some magnetic substances. The diamagnetic KZnF 3 shows the normal behaviour of conduction, though the slope of the thermal conductivity versus temperature is somewhat lower owing to the impurity scattering of phonons than that being expected from Umklapp processes.},

Sb doping in GeTe decreases the carrier concentration due to the donor dopant nature of Sb and enhances the valence band degeneracy by increasing the cubic nature of the sample, which collectively boost Seebeck coefficient in the temperature range of 300–773 K. Significant thermal conductivity reduction was achieved due to collective phonon scattering from various meso-structured domain variants, twin and inversion boundaries, nanostructured defect layers, and solid solution point defects. The high performance Ge0.9Sb0.1Te sample shows mechanical stability (Vickers microhardness) of ∼206 H v, which is significantly higher compared to other popular thermoelectric materials such as Bi2Te3, PbTe, PbSe, Cu2Se, and TAGS.}},

Its thermoelectric conversion efficiency, however, is low due to its relatively high thermal conductivity. ZnSb has potential as a thermoelectric material if this can be reduced. Nanostructuring of bulk materials and introducing extrinsic particles have been shown to lower lattice thermal conductivity. In this study we created the microstructure by ball-milling of bulk ZnSb and added Ag particles which attain sizes in the micrometer range in this milling process. Hot-pressing was used to obtain dense samples. Several techniques were used for structural characterization. Here we report on scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray diffraction analysis. Thermoelectrical measurements were conducted around room temperature. Thermal conductivity was reduced by up to 40\% by the reported nanostructuring. However, the electrical conductivity and the Seebeck coefficient were adversely affected, leading to no overall improvement in performance.}},
